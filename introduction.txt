Key Features of Java

Platform Independent

Java achieves platform independence through the use of bytecode. The Java compiler converts source code into bytecode, which can be executed on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Java code compiled on one platform can run on any other platform that supports Java

Simplicity

Java's syntax is simple and easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++. It eliminates complex features like pointers and multiple inheritances, making it easier to write, debug, and maintain code
